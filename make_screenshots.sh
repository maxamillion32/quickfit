# Automates building for screengrab, launching the emulators and taking screenshots
# for all 3 form factors
# Depends on https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/screengrab
# Currently (2016-04-06), screengrab fails like https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/2077
# Reverting to version 0.38.0 of fastlane_core worked:
# sudo gem install fastlane_core -v 0.38.0
# sudo gem uninstall fastlane_core -v 0.41.2
# Installed version of fastlane_core can be seen in the path of
# command_executor.rb in the stacktrace.
